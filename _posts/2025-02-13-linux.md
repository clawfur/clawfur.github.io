My daily driver - for the moment - is a decent-ish laptop with Mint installed.  It has pretty much everything I'd want on it and it runs whatever I throw at it without complaint or fuss.

I didn't opt for Windows because:
- Haven't been in "the ecosystem" for years now
- Slow and unreliable for my use case
- Not interested in having to go through and yank out bloatware/similar just to have a *usable* experience

## Why choose Mint?

Mint is a fine distro, simple as.

> It's pretty easy to setup.  Plug in a Mint USB and there you go.

I've used it almost continuously in some form since 2012!  I tried other distros but they were either not fit for my needs or they were gimmicky (see ElementaryOS, Peppermint, etc), so Mint is what I stick with since the devs rarely introduce breaking changes and they like to consider their users' opinions/thoughts.

## Try it out today

If you have some time, try it out on a virtual machine or on bare metal and see.
